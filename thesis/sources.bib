  abstract = {A framework for determining the shortest path and the distance
              between every pair of vertices on a spatial network is presented.
              The framework, termed SILC, uses path coherence between the
              shortest path and the spatial positions of vertices on the spatial
              network, thereby, resulting in an encoding that is compact in
              representation and fast in path and distance retrievals. Using this
              framework, a wide variety of spatial queries such as incremental
              nearest neighbor searches and spatial distance joins can be shown
              to work on datasets of locations residing on a spatial network of
              sufficiently large size. The suggested framework is suitable for
              both main memory and disk-resident datasets.},
