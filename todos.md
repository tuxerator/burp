# TODO
* Randomized representant
* Effect of different representant
* Finding concrete (worst) cases (in-path/not=in-path)
  * All children are in-path/not-in-path

# Goals

* Reason for low block occupancy
* Formal verification of Space bound
* Lower space complexity/bound

# Possible Improvements

* only necessary split
* using Euclidean distances
